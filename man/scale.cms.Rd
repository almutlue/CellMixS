\usage{
\method{scale}{cms}(knn, cms_raw, cell_names, k_min, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{knn}{List containing distances and batch information of cells. Should have one slot type double named "distance" with distances towards the k nearest neighbours of the cell and one slot type double named after the group variable specified in 'batch'.
Both slots need to be aligned and the specified cell's name need to correspond to one of the rownames, while the columns represent the ordered knn.}

\item{cms_raw}{Matrix containing raw cms scores for all cells specified in cell_names and knn. Rownames need to correspond to cellnames and colnames should be "cms".}

\item{cell_names}{Character vector with cell names corresponding to the rownames of the list elements in the knn object and the cms_raw object.}

\item{k_min}{Numeric giving the minimum number of k nearest neighbours to use. cells to include.
If k_min is defined the overall distance density distribution of knn will be determined and only cells up to the first local minima that includes more than kmin cells will be used.}

\item{k}{Numeric, defining the number of k-nearest neighbours to use for testing the "mixing" within the neighbourhood.}

\description{
Performs weighted scaling of cms scores
}
\details{
Internal function to scale cms scores if \code{\link{cms.pca}} = TRUE. Replaces cms scores by weigthed means of cms scores within the k-nearest neighbourhood.
Reciprocal distances are used as weights. Returns a matrix with "scaled-cms" and original "cms" values.
