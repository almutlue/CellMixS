\title{Toolbox to explore batch effects and data integration in scRNA data.}
\description{
\pkg{CellMixS} provides metrics and functions to evaluate batch effects,
data integration and batch effect correction in single cell trancriptome
data with single cell resolution. Results can be visualized and summarised
on different levels, e.g. on cell, celltype or dataset level.
}
\details{
In particular, \pkg{CellMixS} includes two main metrics:
Cellspecific mixing scores to determine the probability of random mixing
in each cell's neighbourhood. It can be assesed via the \code{\link{cms}} function.
Local Density Factor Differences to evaluate the effect of data
integration methods on batch internal structures. It can be assesed via the
\code{\link{ldfDiff}} function.
